Evaluation of  defeciency identifier of plants


According to implementation,   I have got 80% accuracy.
InceptionV3 as the model to train the dataset.
I have categorized the images of the leaves according to nitrogen percentage.
I have used different transfer learning methods such as Vgg 16, 
Resnet,Inception v3 and measure the accuracy.Transfer learning technique inception V3 gave high
 accuracy among the other techniques I have used, and  image classification
task as properly done ith the given data set.  
Also the correct nitrogen percentage was given as an output after I test it.
